                        <p>My role influenced not just product features, but how Tridonic builds all its digital
                            products, directly impacting operational efficiency and the overall digital strategy for IoT

                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>One significant challenge was initial resistance from some legacy teams who were accustomed to their
                    existing workflows and had concerns about the effort required for adoption. We addressed this by
                    running targeted pilot programs with these teams, meticulously showcasing the tangible time savings
                    and improved consistency on their specific projects. This built internal champions and led to
                    broader adoption.</p>

                <h3>Future Vision for TDS</h3>
                <p>The roadmap for TDS focuses on continuous evolution: expanding to support native mobile applications,
                    exploring AI-powered design tools for automated component generation, and refining our contribution
                    model. TDS will continue to be a strategic enabler for Tridonic's digital product innovation in the
                    IoT and lighting space, adapting to emerging technologies and evolving user needs.</p>
