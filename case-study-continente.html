                <h3>Market Context: Navigating a Nascent E-grocery Landscape</h3>
                <p>In 2012, the Portuguese e-grocery market was nascent, with online penetration at just 0.9%. Consumers prioritized price, range, and convenience, while retailers faced high operational costs and consumer skepticism about online product quality, as users often wanted to "see or touch" products.</p>
                <p>Portugal was recovering from a severe economic downturn, leading to subdued consumer confidence. This made Portuguese consumers acutely sensitive to price, often shopping in multiple supermarkets, seeking greater value and promotions without compromising quality. This presented a delicate balancing act for Continente in building loyalty amidst these multifaceted challenges, which defined the complex environment for Continente.pt's online growth.</p>

                <h3>Problem Definition: Addressing Core Bottlenecks</h3>
                <p>Continente.pt faced significant challenges, including low conversion rates (typically between 1.4% and 3%) and a substantial 75% cart abandonment rate at checkout. These issues, compounded by the unique characteristics of a nascent and price-sensitive Portuguese e-grocery market, contributed to suboptimal customer lifetime value (CLV) and average order value (AOV).</p>
                
                <h3>Opportunity: Paving the Way for Market Leadership</h3>
                <p>Despite the challenges, the nascent e-grocery market presented a significant opportunity for Continente.pt, as a pioneer, to define and dominate the online grocery space. By strategically addressing the identified bottlenecks through a strong focus on user experience and data-driven marketing, there was immense potential to capture market share, build customer loyalty, and drive substantial revenue growth in an underdeveloped sector. This was a chance to innovate and set new standards for online grocery shopping in Portugal.</p>

                <p>A robust and multi-faceted research process was supported, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. This comprehensive approach was essential for identifying friction points and opportunities across the entire customer journey, directly informing our strategic decisions and leading to measurable improvements.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Optimizing New User Acquisition</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> New user sign-ups declining despite higher marketing spend.</p>
                <p>To understand the barriers to new user sign-ups and benchmark best practices, we conducted in-depth user interviews with prospective and recently registered users, alongside a comprehensive competitor analysis. This dual approach ensured our proposed solutions were relevant and competitive, addressing both internal friction and external market expectations.</p>
                <p>Our research revealed that lengthy registration and an unclear value proposition deterred sign-ups, whereas competitors offered instant access. This insight directly informed our decision to streamline the initial interaction: we implemented social login options to drastically reduce manual data entry and redesigned the landing page to prominently feature clear, upfront discount offers. This was done to minimize perceived effort and maximize perceived benefit, making the onboarding process quick and rewarding for users.</p>

                <h3>2. Optimizing Thematic Landing Page Engagement & AOV</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Inconsistent engagement and Average Order Value (AOV) on thematic landing pages.</p>
                <p>To improve engagement and AOV on thematic landing pages, we conducted extensive A/B testing on various design variants. This involved meticulously crafting different layouts, visual styles, and content presentations, then analyzing heatmaps and click-through rates (CTR) to understand which elements most effectively captivated users and encouraged higher spending.</p>
                <p>These tests consistently showed that simplistic and flat elements with prominent value propositions significantly boosted engagement and AOV. Recognizing this clear user preference for clean interfaces and straightforward value, we redesigned the thematic landing pages with these principles in mind. This strategic shift aimed to reduce cognitive load, enhance visual appeal, and immediately highlight user benefits, thereby encouraging deeper engagement and larger purchases on specific campaigns.</p>

                <h3>3. Optimizing Seasonal Banner Performance</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Seasonal banners had low (12%) click-through despite spend.</p>
                <p>To understand why seasonal banners had low click-through rates, we conducted in-depth heatmap and eye-tracking analysis. This allowed us to precisely pinpoint where users were focusing their attention (or not focusing it) on the page and how their gaze moved across content, providing crucial data on the banners' ineffectiveness in their current placements.</p>
                <p>The analysis clearly revealed that 83% of users ignored the banners, instead gravitating towards search and navigation. This direct insight informed our strategic decision to reposition banners from their traditional, often overlooked, locations to areas closer to the search bar and primary navigation, which were confirmed high-attention zones. We also enhanced their visual contrast and refined messaging to make them stand out without being intrusive, directly addressing the visibility issue identified by eye-tracking and improving their performance.</p>

                <h3>4. Enhancing Product Discovery & Navigation</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users abandoned after 5+ min Browse, no cart adds.</p>
                <p>To address the issue of users abandoning after browsing without adding items to their cart, we performed comprehensive customer journey mapping. This involved charting typical user paths, analyzing clickstreams, time-on-page data, and user session recordings to uncover friction points and identify where users got stuck or left the site. This mapping revealed that poorly organized categories and an overwhelming number of redundant product variants caused significant decision fatigue.</p>
                <p>To counter this, we initiated a project to streamline the main navigation menu, reorganizing categories into more logical and intuitive groupings. Furthermore, we integrated AI-driven bundle suggestions, which proactively offered curated product combinations based on user behavior and preferences. These improvements effectively guided users to relevant products more efficiently and simplified their choices, thereby reducing abandonment rates.</p>

                <h3>5. Reducing Checkout Abandonment</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> 75% cart abandonment at checkout.</p>
                <p>To tackle the high cart abandonment rate, we conducted extensive A/B testing on various iterations of the checkout flow. We meticulously tracked completion rates, time spent on each step, and error rates across different versions (e.g., fewer steps, different form layouts, varied messaging for substitution options) to precisely identify elements causing friction and leading to abandonment.</p>
                <p>These tests unequivocally showed that complex forms and ambiguous product substitution options were major friction points. To directly address these insights, we redesigned the checkout process into a simplified 5-step flow, breaking down information into manageable chunks. We integrated autofill functionalities to reduce typing effort and introduced a clear, visual substitution preview feature, allowing users to easily understand and manage potential product changes. These targeted improvements made the checkout experience smoother and more transparent, significantly reducing abandonment.</p>

                <h3>6. Addressing Hidden Shipping Costs</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> 65% abandoned carts after seeing shipping costs.</p>
                <p>To understand why a significant portion of carts were abandoned after shipping costs were revealed, we performed an in-depth funnel analysis. This involved scrutinizing user behavior across the entire conversion path, with a particular focus on quantifying drop-off rates at the exact point where unexpected fees appeared.</p>
                <p>The analysis starkly highlighted that the sudden appearance of shipping costs late in the checkout process was a major abandonment trigger. To counteract this, we implemented a strategic change: offering free shipping for orders exceeding a certain threshold (≥50 €), prominently communicating this incentive earlier in the user journey. We also introduced a clear cart progress indicator, displaying the remaining amount required to qualify for free shipping.

                <h3>7. Improving New User Retention</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Only 15% of new users became repeat buyers.</p>
                <p>To address the low retention rate among new users, we conducted a comprehensive cohort analysis. This involved segmenting new users based on their initial purchase categories (e.g., pantry staples vs. perishables) and meticulously tracking the retention rates of these different cohorts over time to identify patterns and correlations between initial behavior and long-term engagement.</p>
                <p>This analysis revealed a significant insight: customers who initially purchased pantry staples had 3x higher retention rates than those buying perishables. Leveraging this, we developed a strategy for personalized 'Pantry Starter' recommendations for new users, actively promoting these high-retention categories immediately after their first purchase. This targeted personalization aimed to guide new users towards products that statistically correlated with higher long-term engagement and increased customer lifetime value.</p>

                <h3>8. Facilitating Repeat Purchases</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users abandoned carts when reordering, couldn't find past items.</p>
                <p>To address users struggling with repeat purchases, we performed a detailed feature benchmarking of leading e-commerce platforms and direct competitors. This involved examining their "buy again" features, past purchase history displays, and quick-add options to identify best-in-class solutions and missing functionalities on our platform.</p>
                <p>The benchmarking clearly showed a gap in our platform compared to competitors who excelled at facilitating repeat purchases. To address this, we implemented a dedicated 'Buy Again' section, prominently displaying previous purchases with quick-add buttons. We also introduced smart suggestions based on past order history and frequently bought together items. This directly responded to competitive insights, effectively reducing friction for loyal customers and making the reordering process effortless and intuitive.</p>

                <h3>9. Streamlining Recurring Order Modifications</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users struggled to modify recurring orders, causing support calls.</p>
                <p>To alleviate the burden on support and improve user experience with recurring orders, we conducted extensive task analysis and created detailed flowcharts. This involved observing users, conducting usability tests, and analyzing support ticket data to map the existing convoluted processes, identifying every step, decision point, and point of frustration within the current flow.</p>
                <p>This meticulous analysis clearly illustrated the excessive number of steps and redundant data entry required for recurring order modifications. Our response was to consolidate the process into a single, intuitive, step-by-step subscription management flow. We redesigned the interface to allow users to modify all aspects of their recurring order on one screen, minimizing navigation and eliminating re-entry errors. This significantly reduced user confusion and consequently, the volume of support calls.</p>

                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Satisfaction plateaued; unclear friction points.</p>
                <p>To address the plateauing customer satisfaction and identify specific friction points, we deployed comprehensive user surveys across various website touchpoints. These surveys gathered both quantitative satisfaction scores and detailed qualitative feedback on areas such as product information, checkout speed, and comparison tools.</p>
                <p>The survey results provided clear directives: users desired more detailed product information, a quicker checkout, and robust comparison tools. In direct response to these insights, we enhanced product pages with richer content, high-quality images, and user reviews. We further optimized the checkout flow (building on previous improvements) and implemented a dedicated product comparison feature. These targeted improvements directly addressed the explicit pain points articulated by our users, significantly enhancing their overall satisfaction and shopping efficiency.</p>

                <p>The design process was iterative, driven by continuous cycles of testing and refinement informed by comprehensive research. My role extended beyond aesthetics, leveraging design as a strategic tool to drive measurable business outcomes, ensuring every visual and interactive element served a clear purpose within the user journey.</p>
                <h3>High-Impact Campaign & Landing Page Design</h3>
                <p>A core responsibility involved designing 200+ campaigns across 50+ categories, delivering high-impact artwork and pages. This required translating both marketing objectives and user observations into visually compelling and conversion-optimized digital assets.</p>
                <h3>Checkout Flow Redesign</h3>
                <p>The checkout experience was a critical area of focus due to high abandonment rates. A/B testing efforts led to the implementation of a 5-step checkout with autofill and substitution preview. This design directly addressed the problem of complex forms and unclear substitution steps that had previously contributed to a 75% cart abandonment rate.</p>
                <h3>Navigation & Product Discovery Enhancement</h3>
                <p>Contributions were made to developing a streamlined menu and incorporating AI-driven bundle suggestions. These improvements were specifically aimed at alleviating decision fatigue caused by poorly organized categories and redundant product variants.</p>
                <h3>Feature Implementation</h3>
                <p>This included the design and integration of essential features such as a Dedicated "Buy Again" with quick-add and suggestions, which significantly improved the reordering process for loyal customers. Additionally, enhanced product pages and a comparison feature were implemented, informed by user surveys.</p>
                <h3>Banner Optimization</h3>
                <p>Seasonal banners were strategically repositioned near search, with better contrast. This optimization significantly improved their visibility and click-through rates.</p>
