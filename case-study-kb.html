                <p>The National Library of the Netherlands (KB - Koninklijke Bibliotheek) faced a significant challenge in processing its "Retro-collection," a backlog of tens of thousands of physical books acquired to fill collection gaps. The traditional manual workflow for de-duplication against existing records and creating new title descriptions was creating a growing bottleneck in expanding the national collection.</p>

            <!-- Section 2: Problem Definition & Opportunity -->
            <section id="problem" class="case-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Problem Definition & Opportunity</h2>
                <p>The core problem was the severe inefficiency of manually processing the Retro-collection. Catalogers spent an average of 15-20 minutes per book on:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Physically checking books against their database for duplicates, often requiring multiple manual searches.</li>
                    <li>Manually transcribing key information (title, author, publisher, year) from physical books, a tedious and error-prone process.</li>
                    <li>Creating new metadata entries from scratch for unique acquisitions, demanding specialized knowledge and significant time.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This resulted in a slow intake process, a growing backlog of tens of thousands of books, and potential inconsistencies in metadata quality.</p>

                <p>Beyond addressing current inefficiencies, leveraging OCR and AI technologies presented a strategic opportunity to revolutionize library cataloging. This initiative positioned the KB to not only automate repetitive tasks and enhance data accuracy but also to significantly accelerate the expansion of the national collection, transforming a bottleneck into a path for digital-age growth and improved accessibility.</p>

            <!-- Section 3: Discovery & Key Insights -->
            <section id="discovery" class="case-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Discovery & Key Insights</h2>
                
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>Our discovery phase was heavily driven by user research. We conducted:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contextual Inquiries:</strong> Observing catalogers in their actual work environment to document their current workflow, revealing nuanced complexities and hidden inefficiencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>In-depth Interviews:</strong> Engaging with experienced catalogers to understand decision-making processes, challenges with unique book formats, and criteria for identifying duplicates or creating new records.</li>
                    <li><strong>Workflow Analysis:</strong> Mapping the step-by-step manual process to pinpoint critical touchpoints where AI/automation could provide the most significant impact.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Technical Research</h3>
                <p>We conducted thorough technological research to identify viable solutions. This involved evaluating various OCR services for accuracy across diverse document types, assessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and custom Machine Learning (ML) models for intelligent data interpretation and matching, and exploring robust API integrations with internal and external data sources like Google Books.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                <p>Our research crystallized several critical insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Volume, Low Automation:</strong> The sheer volume of the Retro-collection (50,000+ books backlog) made manual processing unsustainable, underscoring the urgent need for automation.</li>
                    <li><strong>De-duplication Complexity:</strong> Identifying unique editions required meticulous comparison, necessitating a sophisticated AI matching algorithm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metadata Entry Burden:</strong> Creating comprehensive metadata was time-consuming, highlighting the value of AI-driven preliminary metadata generation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust in Automation:</strong> Catalogers needed high accuracy and easy review/correction mechanisms for AI-generated data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Data Importance:</strong> Information from title pages and colophons was paramount, requiring a robust image-to-text solution.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Section 4: Vision & Strategy -->
            <section id="vision" class="case-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Vision & Strategy</h2>
                <p>The vision involved expanding the tool's capabilities to support more complex cataloging scenarios, integrate with other KB systems, and potentially automate additional steps in the book processing workflow, moving towards a more fully automated intake pipeline. This could include leveraging video capture and analysis to further accelerate the initial data extraction and quality control steps, reducing physical handling and manual inspection time.</p>

                <h3>Challenges & Risks</h3>
                <p>Key challenges and risks identified early included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Integration:</strong> Connecting a new AI tool with Alma, the KB's complex library management system.</li>
                    <li><strong>OCR Accuracy:</strong> Ensuring high accuracy for older or uniquely formatted books with varied typography.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Model Training:</strong> Developing an AI model capable of accurately matching complex book metadata and de-duplicating diverse editions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Quality:</strong> Managing potential errors from OCR or AI and providing easy correction mechanisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Adoption:</strong> Ensuring the tool was intuitive and trustworthy for catalogers to integrate into their daily workflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Section 5: Delivery & Execution -->
            <section id="delivery" class="case-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Delivery & Execution</h2>
                <p>Operating in a Scrum environment, our cross-functional team collaborated closely through daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. As product owner, I drove key delivery tasks, including refining the product backlog and prioritizing features based on user value and business impact, ensuring efficient execution of sprints. Rigorous quality assurance was integrated throughout the development lifecycle, encompassing comprehensive unit and integration tests, as well as performance testing to ensure system responsiveness under load.</p>

                <h3>Roadmap</h3>
                <p>This roadmap presents a structured, multi-phase strategy for developing the AI-powered Retro-Tool, guiding the project from initial proof-of-concept through full integration and future scalability. It prioritizes iterative development, a user-focused design process, and proactive risk management. By providing a clear and comprehensive framework, the roadmap ensures that the Retro-Tool's evolution remains closely aligned with strategic goals, cataloger needs, and the operational demands of library workflows. Relevant considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User Training & Documentation: Comprehensive guides and training sessions.</li>
