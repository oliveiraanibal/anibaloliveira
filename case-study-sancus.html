            <!-- Section 2: Problem Definition & Opportunity -->
             <section id="problem" class="case-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Problem Definition & Opportunity</h2>
                <p>Enterprises generate and store massive amounts of data that often reside in silos, across disparate documents, databases, internal wikis, and legacy systems. This leads to substantial operational inefficiencies.</p>

                <h3>Key pain points included:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information Overload: Employees spend excessive time searching for and gathering information, resulting in significant productivity loss across departments.</li> 
                    <li>Inconsistent Knowledge: Different departments or individuals may hold diverging versions or interpretations of information, leading to errors and misinformed decisions.</li> 
                    <li>Slow Decision-Making: Difficulty accessing timely and accurate information hinders agile decision-making processes, impacting business responsiveness.</li> 
                    <li>Untapped Value: Valuable insights and knowledge within company data remain underutilized, limiting innovation and competitive advantage.</li> 
                    <li>Onboarding & Training Challenges: New employees struggle to quickly acquire company-specific knowledge, prolonging ramp-up times.</li> 
                </ul>
                <h3>Opportunity Landscape</h3>
                <p>In 2023, the market for RAG solutions was rapidly expanding.  Valued at approximately USD 1.04-1.06 billion and projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 44.7% in the following years.  Sancus aimed to capture this by enabling companies to:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce information Search Time</li> 
                    <li>Enhance Decision Making</li> 
                    <li>Streamline Onboarding & Training</li> 
                    <li>Foster Knowledge Sharing</li> 
                </ul>

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>After analyzing potential competitors in the B2B RAG space, we realized that:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Many competitors offered broad data format integrations beyond simple PDFs.</li> 
                    <li>Data privacy and security were major selling points and concerns.</li> 
                    <li>API offerings for custom integrations were common.</li> 
                    <li>Custom document understanding/extraction and UI customization were less common, presenting potential differentiation opportunities for Sancus.</li> 
                    <li>Tiered pricing (standard & premium) was the prevalent model.</li> 
                </ul>
                
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>We undertook a thorough research process to understand user needs and pain points.  This involved focusing on the core 'Jobs' users hire a solution like Sancus for, and developing detailed personas to represent our target users and their unique contexts.</p> 
                
                <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                <p>Based on our research and discovery, several key insights emerged:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Security and Compliance are Non-Negotiable: Enterprises prioritize robust data security, privacy, and compliance features above all else when adopting new AI solutions.</li> 
                    <li>User Experience Drives Adoption: An intuitive, natural language interface proves crucial for overcoming the learning curve associated with new enterprise tools and driving broad user adoption.</li> 
                    <li>Scalability is Paramount: Solutions must handle vast and growing amounts of data, alongside an increasing number of users, without performance degradation.</li> 
                </ul>
