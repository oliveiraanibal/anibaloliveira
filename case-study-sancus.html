             <section id="problem" class="case-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Problem & Opportunity</h2>
                <p>Enterprises generate and store massive amounts of data that often reside in silos, across disparate documents, databases, internal wikis, and legacy systems. This leads to substantial operational inefficiencies. Key pain points include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Information Overload:</strong> Employees spend excessive time searching for and gathering information, resulting in significant productivity loss across departments.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Inconsistent Knowledge:</strong> Different departments or individuals may hold diverging versions or interpretations of information, leading to errors and misinformed decisions.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Slow Decision-Making:</strong> Difficulty accessing timely and accurate information hinders agile decision-making processes, impacting business responsiveness.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Untapped Value:</strong> Valuable insights and knowledge within company data remain underutilized, limiting innovation and competitive advantage.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Onboarding & Training Challenges:</strong> New employees struggle to quickly acquire company-specific knowledge, prolonging ramp-up times.</li> 
                </ul>
                <h3>Opportunity Landscape</h3>
                <p>In 2023, the market for RAG solutions was rapidly expanding.  Valued at approximately USD 1.04-1.06 billion and projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 44.7% in the following years. We developed an Opportunity Solution Tree to visualize the problem space and identify potential solutions.</p>

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>After analyzing potential competitors in the B2B RAG space, we realized that:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Many competitors offered broad data format integrations beyond simple PDFs.</li> 
                    <li>Data privacy and security were major selling points and concerns.</li> 
                    <li>API offerings for custom integrations were common.</li> 
                    <li>Custom document understanding/extraction and UI customization were less common (potential differentiation opportunity).</li> 
                    <li>Tiered pricing (standard & premium) was the prevalent model.</li> 
                </ul>
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>Our user research focused on understanding user needs and pain points. This included creating a Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework to define what users whould hire Sancus for, supplemented by personas for additional context.</p>

                <h3>Go to Market</h3>
                <p>Our GTM strategy used a phased approach, initially targeting mid-sized tech companies with the Sancus MVP through direct sales, strategic partnerships, and digital marketing to validate our offering and secure early beta customers. This positioned us for successful expansion, with subsequent phases focusing on broader data integrations, enhanced enterprise features, and brand awareness. The revenue strategy centered on a flexible, subscription-based model, including tiered pricing adaptable to data volume, user count, or feature sets, with potential for premium add-ons.</p>
